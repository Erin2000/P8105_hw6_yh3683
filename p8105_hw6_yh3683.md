    ## 
    ## 95% Confidence Interval for R-squared: 
    ## Lower bound: 0.8946 
    ## Upper bound: 0.9271

The bootstrap analysis with 5000 samples of the 2017 Central Park
weather data shows R-squared values ranging from 0.89 to 0.93 (95% CI),
with a symmetrical distribution centered around 0.91. This indicates
that minimum temperature explains approximately 90% of the variation in
maximum temperature.

    ## 
    ## 
    ## 95% Confidence Interval for log(β0*β1): 
    ## Lower bound: 1.9642 
    ## Upper bound: 2.0584

The log(β0\*β1) estimates display a normal distribution centered around
2.0, with a 95% confidence interval of \[1.96, 2.06\]. This entirely
positive and narrow interval confirms a significant and stable positive
relationship between minimum and maximum temperatures.

The odds ratio for solving homicides involving male victims in Baltimore
is 0.3547, with a confidence interval of 0.2672 to 0.4679. This
indicates significantly lower odds of solving male victim cases compared
to female victims.

The plot shows the estimated odds ratios for solving homicides involving
male victims compared to female victims across various U.S. cities.
There is notable variation, with some cities (e.g., Fresno, CA, and
Minneapolis, MN) showing higher odds of solving male homicides, while
others (e.g., New York, NY) show higher odds for female homicides.

This plot indicates no clear patterns, suggesting that the linear
regression model fits the data reasonably well. While there are some
outliers, the residuals are generally centered and exhibit
homoscedasticity (constant variance).

Compare my model to two others:

``` r
my_model <- lm(bwt ~ wtgain + gaweeks + smoken, data = birthweight)
second_model <- lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = birthweight)
third_model <- lm(bwt ~ bhead * blength * babysex, data = birthweight)

residuals_my <- residuals(my_model)
residuals_second <- residuals(second_model)
residuals_third <- residuals(third_model)


residuals_data <- bind_rows(
  data.frame(Model = "My Model", Residuals = residuals_my),
  data.frame(Model = "Second Model", Residuals = residuals_second),
  data.frame(Model = "Third Model", Residuals = residuals_third)
)

The Plot shows residuals centered around 0 for all models, indicating
unbiased predictions. The Third Model has wider tails, suggesting larger
deviations, while My Model and the Second Model have tighter
distributions, indicating better performance.

The Second Model (using blength and gaweeks) makes it the most accurate
predictor of birthweight. My Model performs moderately with a slightly
higher RMSE, while the Third Model has poorer performance likely due to
overfitting caused by the inclusion of complex interactions.
