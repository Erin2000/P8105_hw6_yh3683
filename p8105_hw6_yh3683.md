``` r

```

    ## 
    ## 95% Confidence Interval for R-squared: 
    ## Lower bound: 0.8946 
    ## Upper bound: 0.9271

The bootstrap analysis with 5000 samples of the 2017 Central Park
weather data shows R-squared values ranging from 0.89 to 0.93 (95% CI),
with a symmetrical distribution centered around 0.91. This indicates
that minimum temperature explains approximately 90% of the variation in
maximum temperature, demonstrating a remarkably strong predictive
relationship.

``` r
cat("\n\n95% Confidence Interval for log(β0*β1):", 
    "\nLower bound:", round(log_betas_ci[1], 4),
    "\nUpper bound:", round(log_betas_ci[2], 4))
```

    ## 
    ## 
    ## 95% Confidence Interval for log(β0*β1): 
    ## Lower bound: 1.9642 
    ## Upper bound: 2.0584

The log(β0\*β1) estimates display a normal distribution centered around
2.0, with a 95% confidence interval of \[1.96, 2.06\]. This entirely
positive and narrow interval confirms a significant and stable positive
relationship between minimum and maximum temperatures, providing strong
evidence for the reliability of our linear model.
